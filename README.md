## Project Overview  
This project will develop and compare two Nature Inspired algorithms: Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA). Comparison will be based on various metrics: correctness of TSP solution, elapsed time, minimum number of iterations, and algorithm complexity.

## Used Technologies  
- **Python** were choosen as main programming language
- **Deap** python libraty for fast and efficient implementation of GA applications

## Dataset
Our dataset is a fully connected graph with **36** nodes. Each node represents building in Innopolis city. All coordinates of buildings were manually collected with use of 'Yandex Maps'. After, coordinates were processed to get distance graph. All information about data processing can be found [here](utils/graph_builder.ipynb), all datasets located in [data](data/) folder 

## Roadmap  
- 🟢 Weeks 1-2:
  - 🟢 Dataset building
- 🟡 Weeks 3-4:
  - 🟡 Devolopment of GA and ACO
  - 🟡 Validation of GA and ACO
- 🟠 Weeks 5-6:
  - 🟠 Evaluation of performance of both algorithms
  - 🟠 Aquiring of metrics
- 🟠 Weeks 7-8:
  - 🟠 Analisys of algorithms performance
  - 🟠 Identifying key strengths of each algorithm
- 🟠 Week 9:
  - 🟠 Final presentation of acquired results
