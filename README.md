## Project Overview  
This project will develop and compare two Nature Inspired algorithms: Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA). Comparison will be based on various metrics: correctness of TSP solution, elapsed time, minimum number of iterations, and algorithm complexity.

## Used Technologies  
- **Python** were choosen as main programming language
- **Deap** python libraty for fast and efficient implementation of GA applications

## Roadmap  
- 🟢 Weeks 1-2:
  - 🟢 Dataset building
- 🟢 Weeks 3-4:
  - 🟡 Devolopment of GA and ACO
  - 🟡 Validation of GA and ACO
- 🟠 Weeks 5-6:
  - 🟠 Evaluation of performance of both algorithms
  - 🟠 Aquiring of metrics
- 🟠 Weeks 7-8:
  - 🟠 Analisys of algorithms performance
  - 🟠 Identifying key strengths of each algorithm
- 🟠 Week 9:
  - 🟠 Final presentation of acquired results
